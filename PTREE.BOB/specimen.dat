Specimen data file for ptree. C comments are allowed in the file

Mutations are labeled 1, 2, ....
The root is labeled 0.
Input is a gene tree of mutation paths from the leaves of the tree to the 
root 0. 
Note that multiplicities come after sequences for ptree.
example: ptree specimen.dat 1.5 2.5 3.0
It is possible to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of theta
by using a fine enough grid for theta values.
If the "age flag" is given on the command line, then 6 is supposed the
youngest mutation, to 1 the oldest. This allows a likelihood comparison
of various possible age trees.

Computations are exact using ptree, the probability is evaluated by
running through all possible genealogies. Try out smaller samples to find
the capabilities of the machine that ptree runs on.

Details of the model, algorithm etc are given in

infinitely-many-site model. J. Math. Biol. 27, 667-680.

genetics. Statistical Science 9, 307-319.
Likelihoods can be found for much larger samples using the techniques in this 
paper by simulation. The program, however has a more complex user interface.
