## Overview
LCE is a C++ class library for lumped coalescent experiments that builds on libsequence (C++ class library for population genetics http://molpopgen.org/software/libsequence.html , boost (Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries http://www.boost.org/) and GSL (Gnu Scientific Library http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). LCE, libsequence and GSL are distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and boost is distributed under the boost license.

lce0.1 works for our research needs but is not autoconfiscated yet.

The goal of lce is to provide a code-base for inference in population geentics that takes advantage of a set of diverse tools, including extended arithmetics, computational algebraic algorithms and graph algorithms.

### LCE library provides the following features:

* MCT: Markov Chains on Trees -- for simulating the evolution of repetitive and non-repetitive DNA on demographically and spatially structured ancestral recombination graphs and conducting Approximate Bayesian Computations.
* EBC: Approximate Bayesian Computation Done Exactly -- Generating realisations for lumped coalescent processes, Integrations over irreducible graphs via Markov bases, etc.
* Generating structured ancestral recombination graphs (via libsequence and ms).

To learn how to use libsequence, boost and the GSL go to the appropriate help documents.

The work on LCE started during Raazesh Sainudiin's and Kevin Thornton's post-doctoral work at Cornell. Raazesh Sainudiin continued working on LCE during his subsequent post-doctoral work at The University of Oxford. It was significantly improved and extended by Jenny Harlow. Many other colleagues have contributed to the realization of LCE. Special thanks go to:

## TO COMPILE

You are assumed to have the following GNU General Public Licensed 
or boost licensed libraries already installed
1. libsequence http://molpopgen.org/software/libsequence.html

2. GSL http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

3. boost http://www.boost.org/

Then you need to be brave, stubbrn and read the Makefiles in each directory to figure out the process.
