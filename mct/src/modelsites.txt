Need to:

extract data from file. Put this into a class:

struct ModelLine {
    string modelname;
    int num_sites;
    map<string, string> opts;
    int lineno;
}

From this, we find the correct model name, and check that the options are all
valid for that model.

The Model can then be created with the appropriate options set.
